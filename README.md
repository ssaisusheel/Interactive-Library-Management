# Interactive-Library-Management
A Unified Java application for both students and employees  of a college library
The project titled INTERACTIVE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a library management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. 
Its main idea is to implement a secured software application for the college library which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new member, new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and facility to borrow and return books, without any use of student library cards.
Generally these operations are carried out using student library cards that are issued by library to students. 
Though these methods are successful and have been prevalent throughout the system, it is always tedious for a student to carry the library card to lend or return a book, it is even economically burdensome for the system to manage and maintain these cards.
Interactive Library Management System also provides a single standalone application that can be used by a librarian to review the transactions and maintenance of library, a library staff to add new member, new book and updating information in the database, a student to lend and return books by just using his/her identification number. 
So, separate applications are not required for the management of library. 
Therefore, Interactive Library Management System provides a best platform for the maintenance of a college library.
